The Pig game is a dice game played between two players. Players take turns rolling a die and accumulating points. If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points for that turn. Otherwise, they add the rolled number to their turn total and can choose to hold and add that total to their overall score. The first player to reach a predetermined score, often 100 points, wins the game.
